# Copy Notes
Welcome to the Copy Notes project.

The intention is to create a quick copy and paste Chrome extension to help with text we have to frequently copy and paste.

The main objective is practicing and getting the hang of unit testing.
For this purpose I'm using Jest api.

Feel free to use, modify an learn together.

## Features
With this extension you can:
- [x] Copy to your clipboard the text within the buttons with just one click.
- [x] You can create more entries or delete changing the "popup.html" (it will change, I promise =D).

## Upcomming features
- [ ] User experience to create and delete entries.
- [ ] Drag and drop sorting.
- [ ] Export data as JSON.

Great MAYBE
- [ ] Implementation of data-encription (if it's poss√≠ble).
